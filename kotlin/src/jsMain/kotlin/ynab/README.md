# Kotlin bindings for YNAB official JavaScript SDK

This should be its own library "soon".

Generated by running dukat on ynab's official javascript SDK
Then a lot of manual hacking at it

It seems to be better if I use TS compiler to generate decl files
Requires less hacking but still a bunch

I wonder if there's an easier way to generate the type decls we needâ€¦
